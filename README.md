# Task

Students will build a simple task tracking app to practice project planning, progress tracking, MVC separation, intermediate table view features, and Core Data.
Students who complete this project independently are able to:

## Project Planning, Model Objects and Controllers, Persistence with Core Data
* identify and build a simple navigation view hierarchy
* create a model object using Core Data
* implement the UITableViewDataSource protocol
* implement a static UITableView
* create a custom UITableViewCell
* write a custom delegate protocol
* use a date picker as a custom input view
* wire up view controllers to model object controllers
* add a Core Data stack to a project
* implement basic data persistence with Core Data

## View Hierarchy
1. Create a UITableViewController file called `TaskListTableViewController`
2. Add a UITableViewController scene to your `Main.storyboard` that will be used to list tasks. Class it as a `TaskListTableViewController`
3. Embed the scene in a UINavigationController and set it as your app's initial entry point
4. In your `TaskListTableViewController`, set your table view's prototype style to `basic` (_we will change this later to be a custom style_)
5. Give your cell a reuseIdentifier of `taskCell`
6. Add an `Add` system bar button item to the navigation bar
7. Create a UIViewController file called  `TaskDetailViewController` 
8. Add a UIViewController scene to your `Main.storyboard` that will be used to view and/or create a task. Class it as a `TaskDetailViewController`
9. Add a segue from the Add bar button item from the first scene to the second scene (_This segue will not pass data, and therefore will not need an identifier_)
10. Add a segue from the prototype cell in the first scene to the second scene (_This segue will pass data, so you must give it an identifier_)
11. In your `TaskDetailViewController` scene, and a `Save` bar button item in the right side of your navigation bar
12. Add the following view elements and constrain them how you would like:
    * UITextField (this is where the user will add the task's name). Give the text field a placeholder text of "Enter task name..."
    * UITextView (this is where the user will add the task's notes). Replace the default text with "Enter notes here..."
    * UIDatePicker (this is where the user will select the task's due date)
13. Create the following IBOutlets from the above views:
    * `taskNameTextField`
    * `taskNotesTextView`
    * `taskDueDatePicker`
14. Create the following IBActions from the above views:
    * `saveButtonTapped`
    * `dueDatePickerDateChanged`
    
## Add a Core Data Stack
You will add a CoreDataStack class that will initialize your persistent store, coordinator, and managed object context. Then you will build your Core Data data model.
* Create a new file called CoreDataStack.swift.
* Import CoreData and then add the following code to the file:

```
enum CoreDataStack {
    
    static let container: NSPersistentContainer = {
        
        let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: "Task_CoreData")
        container.loadPersistentStores { (_, error) in
            if let error = error {
                fatalError("Error loading persistent stores: \(error)")
            }
        }
        return container
    }()
    
    static var context: NSManagedObjectContext { container.viewContext }
    
    static func saveContext() {
        if context.hasChanges {
            do {
                try context.save()
            } catch {
                print("Error saving context: \(error)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

* note: You do not need to memorize this, but do your best to understand what is going on in each line of code in your CoreDataStack

## Implement Core Data Model
* Add a New Entity called Task with attributes for name (String), notes (String), dueDate (Date), and isComplete (Bool).
* Use the Data Model inspector to set notes and dueDate to optional values and give isComplete a default value of false.

Now you need to add a convenience initializer for your Task objects that matches what would normally be a member-wise initializer. NSManagedObjects have a designated initializer called init(entity: NSEntityDescription, insertInto context: NSManagedObjectContext?) and a convenience initializer called init(context: NSManagedObjectContext). You will write your own convenience initializer that uses the NSManagedObject convenience initializer and sets the properties on a Task object.
* Create a new file called Task+Convenience.swift.
* Add an extension to Task and create your convenience initializer inside of the extension
    * note: Make sure the initializer has parameters for name, notes, dueDate, and context and that each parameter takes in the right type (context will be of type NSManagedObjectContext).
    * note: Remember that notes and dueDate are optional, therefore, you can give them default values of nil. Also, give context a default value of CoreDataStack.context.
* Inside the body of the initializer set your Task properties and call the NSManagedObject convenience initializer and pass in context from your own convenience initializer —> self.init(context: context)


* Create function signatures for add(taskWithName name: String, notes: String?, dueDate: Date?), update(task: Task, name: String, notes: String?, dueDate: Date?), remove(task: Task), and fetchTasks().

## Create a TaskController
Create a TaskController model object controller that will manage and serve Task objects to the rest of the application.

1. Create a `TaskController.swift` file and define a new `TaskController` class inside
2. Create a `shared` property as a shared instance
3. Add a `tasks` property and set it to be an array of `Task` objects, with a default value of empty
4. Create the following CRUD function signatures:
    * `createTaskWith(name: String, notes: String?, dueDate: Date?)`
    * `fetchTasks()`
    * `update(task: Task, name: String, notes: String?, dueDate: Date?)`
    * `toggleIsComplete(task: Task)`

5. Go through each CRUD function and build out the logic.
* Create should create a `Task` and then call your `CoreDataStack.saveContext()`.
* Fetch should go to your `CoreDataStack.context` and fetch all of your `Task` objects. (_Hint: You will need to create a fetchRequest_). Once you have fetched you tasks, you need to assign them to your array of task objects (source of truth).
* Update should update the passed in task with the new values that were passed in, and then call your `CoreDataStack.saveContext()`
* ToggleIsComplete should simply flip the boolean status of a tasks `isComplete` property. Don't forget to call your `CoreDataStack.saveContext()`

## TaskListTableViewController
Go to TaskListTableViewController.swift and finish setting up your views.

1. Implement the UITableViewDataSource functions using `TaskController.shared.tasks` as your source of truth
2. Setup your cells to display the name of the task (_We will change this later to be a custom cell_)
3. You will want your table view to reload each time it appears, so add the override function `viewWillAppear()` to your code and then call your `fetchTasks()` and tell your table view to reload its data.

Recall that you created two segues from the List View to the Detail View. The segue from the plus button will tell the TaskDetailTableViewController that it should create a new task. The segue from a selected cell will tell the TaskDetailTableViewController that it should display a previously created task and save any changes made to it.

5. Implement the prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) function. Be sure to check the identifier of the segue, get the destination of the segue, then get the index path for the selected row and use that index path to pass the selected task to `TaskDetailViewController` (_Hint: To do this, you will need to go to your `TaskDetailViewController` and setup a landing pad property to receive the task_)

## TaskDetailViewController
1. If you haven't already, delete any boiler-plate code, including the navigation section
2.  If you haven't already, create an optional landing pad property to receive a task from your `TaskListTableViewController`. (_Consider naming this `task`_)
3. Add a property, `var date: Date?`. This will be used to capture the user's selected due date
4. Build out your `saveButtonTapped` IBAction. Make sure to pop the view controller after your code has been executed. (_Note: If your `task` landing pad is nil, this button should create a new task. If your `task` has a value, then the save button should update your existing task. Make sure, in both instances, to pass the task name, notes, and date (from the `date` variable you created._)
5. In your `dueDatePickerDateChanged` IBAction, set the `date` variable you created to the date value of your `taskDueDatePicker`

Your Detail View should follow the ‘updateViews’ pattern for updating the view elements with the details of a model object.

6. Add an `updateViews()` function. In the body of the function, make sure a task exists. If one does, update all the view elements to reflect the necessary data (task name, task notes, task due date) 

Give your app a test run. You should be able to create a new task and then see it on your `TaskListTableViewController`. You should also be able to click on a cell to see the details of a task as well as be able to update those details. If you have any issues, spend 20 minutes debugging, and if you are unable to find a resolution, send a message in the queue channel.

## Custom Table View Cell
Build a custom table view cell to display tasks. The cell should display the task name and have a button that acts as a checkmark to display and toggle the completion status of the task.

1. Add a new file called `TaskTableViewCell.swift` as a subclass of UITableViewCell (delete the `awakeFromNib()` and `setSelected()` functions)
2. Assign the new class to the prototype cell on the `TaskListTableViewController` Scene in `Main.storyboard`
3. Change the prototype cell's style from basic to custom and design the prototype cell with a label on the left and a square button on the right
    * Note: If you are using a stack view, constrain the aspect ratio of the button to 1:1 to force the button into a square that gives the remainder of the space to the label
    * note: Use the image edge inset to shrink the image to not fill the entire height of the content view, you can adjust the image edge insets in the Size Inspector of the UIButton
4. Remove text from the button, but add an image of an empty checkbox
    * note: Use the ‘complete’ and ‘incomplete’ image assets included in the project folder
5. Create an IBOutlet for the label named `taskNameLabel`
6. Create an IBOutlet for the button named `completionButton`
7. Create an IBAction for the button named `completionButtonTapped` which you will implement using a custom protocol in the next step

## Implement the update views pattern on the TaskTableViewCell

1. On your `TaskTableViewCell`, create an optional task variable in order for the `TaskListTableViewController` to pass a specific task to the cell
2. Add a `didSet` property observer to the task variable that you just created (leave the body blank for now)
3. Add an `updateViews()` function. In the body of this function first make sure that you have a task, then assign the task's name to you `taskNameLabel`, and check you task's `isComplete` status. If your status is true, set the `completionButton` to have a background of the complete image (in your assets). If the status is false, set it to have a background of the incomplete image.
4. Go back to the body of your `didSet` on your `task` variable, and call `updateViews()`
5. We will come back to the `completionButtonTapped` IBAction shortly. For now, update your `cellForRowAt` data source function in your `TaskListTableViewController` to cast your cell as a `TaskTableViewCell`, and then to pass a given task over to the cell.
* _Step 5 is a tough one. Give it your best shot. If you cannot work it out after 20 minutes, reach out in the queue channel for assistance._ 

## Custom Protocol
In this next section, you will write a protocol for the `TaskTableViewCell` to delegate handling a button tap to the `TaskListTableViewController`, adopt the protocol, and use the delegate method to mark the task as complete and reload the cell.

1. Add a protocol named `TaskCompletionDelegate` to the top of your `TaskTableViewCell.swift` file (above the class)
2. In the body of your protocol, define a required `taskCellButtonTapped(_ sender: TaskTableViewCell)` function (keep in mind, you only need a function signature, no body)
* _Hint: Don't forget to conform your protocol to `AnyObject`_
3. Add an optional `delegate` property on the `TaskTableViewCell`
* _Hint: remember to make this a weak var_
4. Update the `completionButtonTapped` IBAction to check if a delegate is assigned, and if so, call the delegate protocol function
5. Adopt the protocol in the `TaskListTableViewController` class
* _Hint: I recommend you do this via an extension_
6. Implement the `taskCellButtonTapped` delegate function, guard to make sure you have a task, and then call your `toggleIsComplete` function on your `TaskController`. After that, re-call your `updateViews()` function on the sender.
7. One final step, your cell needs to know who it's delegate is. To do this, got to your `cellForRowAt` function on your `TaskListTableViewController` and assign the cell's `delegate` property to the value of `self`.

At this point you should be able to run your project and toggle tasks directly from the tasks list. Test your app. Make sure there are no bugs. Do not forget to test persistence. If you have any issues, spend 20 minutes debugging, and then send a message via the queue channel.

## Black Diamonds
* Add the ability to delete tasks
* Add the task's due date to your custom cell, and use a `dateFormatter` to make the date readable.
* Add support for projects (task parent object), or tags (task child object) to categorize your tasks
* Add support for due date notifications scheduled to fire when the task is due
* Add a segmented control as the title view that toggles whether the table view should display complete or incomplete tasks
* Add a UITapGestureRecognizer to the TaskDetailTableViewController to dismiss the onscreen keyboard when the users taps somewhere on the screen.
* Add automatic resizing to the table view cell with the Notes text view
